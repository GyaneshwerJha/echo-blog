- Why Original Database url required in .env
/* 
    While Prisma might manage connections using this accelerated URL, 
    the original DATABASE_URL is still necessary for Prisma to know where 
    the database resides 
*/

/* 
    The connection pooling service essentially acts as an intermediary between your application and the database, 
    but the original URL is still required by Prisma to understand the underlying database configuration.
*/

/*
    When running migrations or managing the database schema with Prisma, 
    the original DATABASE_URL is needed to apply changes directly to the database. 
    Prismaâ€™s command-line tools rely on this URL to perform schema migrations, 
    introspection, and other database-related operations.
*/

/* 
    The Prisma Client, generated by Prisma, uses the DATABASE_URL to interact with 
    the database. Even if you use a connection pooling service, the client still needs 
    to understand the original database configuration.
